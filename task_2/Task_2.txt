Task 2

Phishing Email Analysis
================================================================================================================

1. Sender Email Address
* Email: desktop-support@securesupportcloud[.]com
* Analysis: The domain securesupportcloud[.]com does not belong to Contoso Corp. This is a clear sign of email spoofing or the use of a fake external domain pretending to be a trusted source.

2. Suspicious Link
* Link Text: Update Now
* Hover Behavior: Since it's a simulated email, the actual link would likely redirect to a training site or a malicious placeholder in a real phishing case.

3. Urgent or Threatening Language in the Email Body
"Failure to do so will result in being locked out of your system starting tomorrow morning..."

4. Request for Company Credentials
      "Use your company credentials to verify your identity."
* Analysis: Legitimate IT departments never ask employees to enter credentials through email links, especially to unknown domains. This is a credential harvesting attempt.

5. Generic Greeting and Branding
* Greeting: "Dear all Contoso Corp employees"
* Analysis: Phishing emails often use generic greetings and vague references to organizations.

6. Absence of Personalization
* The email does not address the recipient by name or include any specific department or internal identifiers.
* Analysis: Real corporate emails are typically personalized.
