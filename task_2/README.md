Obtained a sample phishing email from Caniphish Simulation for educational purpose and used it for analysis.

## Email Subject:
"All Employees : Immediate Software Update Required"

##  Method of Analysis

To evaluate the legitimacy of the email, the following steps were followed:

2. **Examine Senderâ€™s Email Address:**
   - The sender address was reviewed for signs of spoofing or impersonation.

3. **Check for Suspicious Links or Attachments:**
   - Hovered over any hyperlinks to compare the displayed URL with the real one.

4. **Analyze Language Used:**
   - Assessed the body of the email for urgent, threatening, or manipulative language.

5. **Look for Mismatched Branding:**
   - Checked for inconsistencies in logo usage, sender signature, and formatting.

6. **Scan for Grammar and Spelling Errors:**
   - Reviewed the text for typos, awkward phrasing, and grammatical issues.

7. **Assess Personalization:**
   - Checked if the message was tailored to the recipient or overly generic.

8. **Verify Technical Headers (Hypothetical in this case):**
   - Analyzed potential SPF, DKIM, and DMARC status (common spoofing detection).
